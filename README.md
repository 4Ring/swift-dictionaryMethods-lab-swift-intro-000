## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Solve these questions challenging their knowledge of dictionaries and how/when to use them.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows about optionals (should at this point)
## Outline / Notes

*  This should be anywhere between 10-15 questions.
* This will be the last playground file before they get into Xcode labs involving Dictionaries. That being said, I think the last few questions should then be fairly difficult.
* This can even be between 15-20 questions which bring back arrays into a little more, especially the interaction between arrays and dictionaries.
* I'm not against a few questions that might have them try to locate the error and fix it (but not too many)
* I've included the playground file.
